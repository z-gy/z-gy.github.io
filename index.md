# About Me

I am a sophomore at the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. Currently, my primary research focus is on spoken language processing.

I like doing sports, including playing badminton, table tennis, soccer, hiking, and so on. I am also fond of photography, you can find my works on [this page](photography.md). Most of them taken by Nikon Z5.

You can find more information about me on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/z-gy).
